.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
DEM grid-based model using the energy balance to calculate
snowmelt, and to predict runoff, from input data on snow
properties, terrain and region characteristics, precipitation,
and climate.  Similar to the approach used by Anderson
(1976), and Morris (1982), but designed to run on simpler,
more generalizable inputs.  The model was first presented by
Marks (1988), described conceptually by Marks, et. al (1992)
and Marks and Dozier (1992), and then described in great
detail by Marks, et. al (1997).
.PP
The model approximates the snow cover as being composed of
two layers, a surface fixed-thickness active layer and a
lower layer, solving for the temperature (C) and specific
mass (kg/m^2) which is the mass per unit area (from density
* depth (kg/m^3 * m)) for each layer, and then computing the
temperature and specific mass for the snowcover.
.PP
Melt is computed in either layer when the accumulated energy
exceeds the "cold content" or when the "cold content" is >
0.0.  Cold content is the energy required to bring the snow
cover temperature up to freezing (0 C).  Runoff is estimated
when the accumulated melt and liquid H2O content exceeds a
user-defined threshold.
.PP
This version of the model is a simplification of the point
version, snobal, designed to run over a DEM grid or image of
10^4 to 10^6 cells.  It has been successfully tested over
the Emerald Lake basin in the Sierra Nevada (5m DEM, 5x10^4
grid cells), the Boise River basin in Idaho (250m DEM,
3.5x10^4 grid cells), and the Park City drainage in the
Wasatch Mts. of Utah (75m DEM, 8.2x10^4 grid cells) on runs
of 2 weeks to 6 months.  The only constraint on the size of
the grid is available disk storage, memory, and CPU speed.
(A 6 month run over the Park City grid required 500Mb of
input files, generated 1500Mb of output, and took 6.5 hours
on a SUN Ultra 170E with 256Mb of real memory.)

Inputs:
.PP
Input image data are required for initial snowcover and surface
conditions, for input climate data at each time-step,
and for precipitation events.  Initial condition data are
specified only at the beginning of the run.  Precipitation
data include an ASCII file specifying the time since the run
start for the event and the name of the precipitation file,
which contains precipitation mass, % snow, snow density, and
precipitation temperature.

     z         =   elevation (m)
     z_0       =   roughness length (m)
     z_s       =   total snowcover depth (m)

     T_s_0     =   active snow layer temperature (C)
     T_s       =   average snowcover temperature (C)
     h2o_sat   =   % of liquid H2O saturation (relative

                   snowcover to water that snowcover could
                   hold at saturation)
.ft R

     z         =   elevation (m)
     z_0       =   roughness length (m)

     T_s_0     =   active snow layer temperature (C)
     T_s_l     =   temperature of the snowpack's lower
                   layer (C)
     T_s       =   average snowcover temperature (C)
     h2o_sat   =   % of liquid H2O saturation (relative

line has the format:
.sp

     m_pp       =   total precipitation mass (kg/m^2)
     %_snow     =   % of precipitation mass that was snow (0 to 1.0)
     rho_snow   =   density of snowfall (kg/m^3)
     T_pp       =   average precip. temperature (C) (from dew point
                    temperature if available, or can be estimated
                    from air temperature during storm, or minimum
                    daily temperature)
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Like the point model, the DEM-based model will parse mixed
rain/snow events.  It is designed to accept inputs that
could be derived from typical NRCS Snotel data such as total
precipitation, snow mass increase, and temperature.  The
user must estimate average density and percent snow if depth
data are unavailable.  The model makes the following assumptions
about the snow temperature, rain temperature, and
liquid water saturation of the snow:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     when 0.0 < %_snow < 1.0, (a mixed rain/snow event)
          snow temperature = 0.0
          rain temperature = T_pp
          liquid H2O sat.  = 100%
.ft R
.fi

.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     when %_snow = 1.0 and T_pp => 0.0, (a warm snow-only event)
          snow temperature = 0.0
          liquid H2O sat.  = 100%
.ft R
.fi

.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     when %_snow = 1.0 and T_pp < 0.0, (a cold snow event)
          snow temperature = T_pp
          liquid H2O sat.  = 0%
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Input images with climate parameters are required for each
time-step to drive the model.  These 5- or 6-band images
must have a common prefix, and a suffix that indicates the
relative order of the inputs numerically (e.g.,
"input_prefix.N", where "N" is the time-step index).  The
first value of "N" should always be zero (0), and the last
should always be (1 - #_inputs).  "N" should be padded with
zeros so that every value of "N" has the same number of
digits as the last value of "N".  For example, if there are
1200 input files, then "N" will always have 4 digits (e.g.,
input_prefix.0000, input_prefix.0001, ...,
input_prefix.1199).
.PP
Input image (6-band):
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     I_lw   =   incoming thermal (long-wave) radiation (W/m^2)
     T_a    =   air temperature (C)
     e_a    =   vapor pressure (Pa)
     u      =   wind speed (m/sec)
     T_g    =   soil temperature at 0.5 m depth (C)
     S_n    =   net solar radiation (W/m^2)
.ft R
.fi

.PP
If there is no solar radiation (the sun is "down"), the last
band may be omitted.
.PP
Time-steps (data time-step and run time-steps):
.PP
The "data time-step" is the time interval, in minutes,
between the input images.  The model assumes that this
interval is constant.  Because the snowcover energy balance
is very sensitive to diurnal variations in climate (radiation,
temperature, etc.), the "data time-step" must be 360
minutes (6 hours) or less.  Best results are achieved with a
data time-step of 180 minutes (3 hours) or less.  Data
time-steps greater than 60 minutes must be multiples of
whole hours (e.g., 120 minutes, or 180 minutes).
.PP
A "run time-step" is the internal time-step that the model
actually solves the energy balance over.  Because input
values are assumed to be averages over a run time-step, it
is always 60 minutes (1 hour) or less to insure a stable
model solution.  Solution instabilities occur when the run
time-step is too long to account for rapid changes in the
energy balance (e.g., at sun rise or sunset), or when a
layer's mass is too small to accommodate the assumption of
an average flux over the run time-step.
.PP
There are 3 lengths of run time-steps: "normal, medium, and
small".  By default, the model uses the normal run time-step
which is the longest of the three run time-steps.  The normal
time-step must divide evenly into the data time-step
(i.e., the data time-step is an integer multiple of the normal
run time-step).  The input data for a normal run time-
step (climate data and some precipitation values) are computed
from the input records by linear interpolation.
.PP
The shorter run time-steps (medium and small) are to insure
solution stability, and are only used as a layer's mass
diminishes to the user defined threshold.  When either
layer's mass drops below the specified threshold, the model
divides a larger run time-step into shorter run time-steps
(e.g., divides a normal run time-step into medium run time-steps).
There are three mass thresholds; one for each run
time-step: normal, medium, and small.  When a layer's mass
falls below the threshold for the the small run time-step,
the model removes the layer.
.PP
Just as the normal run time-step divides evenly into the
data time-step, each of the two shorter run time-steps must
divide evenly into the next larger run time-step (medium
into normal, small into medium).  And like the normal time-
steps, the input data for medium and small time-steps are
linearly interpolated from the input records.
.PP
Because the mass thresholds will be reached at different
times over the DEM grid, the model solution of the energy
balance at a given time-step may require different run
time-steps over the grid.  This improves model efficiency,
requiring additional iterations only for those grid cells
where the mass is below a critical threshold.
.PP
Outputs:
.PP
The model writes a pair of output images at the end of the
model run, unless the output frequency option (\fB-O) is specified.
Output images are a 10-band energy and mass flux
image, and a 9-band snow condition image.  If the "\fB-O"
option is specified, a pair of output images can be generated
at a frequency up to one per input image.  Typically,
however, output is generated at a lower frequency than
input.  For example if input data time-step is 3 hrs (180
min), and a daily output is required, then the output frequency
is set at "8" (1 pair of output images for every 8
input images).
