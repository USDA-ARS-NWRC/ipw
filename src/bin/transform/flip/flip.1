.SH NAME
.PP
\fBflip\fP - flip an IPW image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBflip\fP [ \fB-l\fP ] [ \fB-s\fP ] [\fI image \fP]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program flips an IPW image.  Either the lines themselves
can be flipped, or the samples within the lines, or both.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-l\fP
Reverse order of image lines
.sp
.TP
\fB-s\fP
Reverse order of image samples in each line
.PP
At least one of \fB-l and/or \fB-s must be specified.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
[\fI image \fP]
	image
.sp
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
An image may be rotated in multiples of 90 degrees as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	flip -s | transpose		#  90 degrees clockwise
	flip -l -s			# 180 degrees
	flip -l | transpose		# 270 degrees
.ft R
.fi

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
None
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
If \fB-l is specified then the entire image must fit into memory.
.PP
If the output image does not have the canonical IPW line (top to
bottom) and sample (left to right) order, then it will be given
an orientation ("or") header describing the non-standard ordering.
.PP
Geodetic ("geo") headers, window ("win") headers, and orientation
("or") headers will be modified if they are present.
