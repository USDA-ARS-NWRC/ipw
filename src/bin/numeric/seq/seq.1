.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Seq was originally written as the "qdips" program "sequence" by Jeff
Dozier, at UCSB.  It was converted to ipw in 1989.
.PP
Seq generates a sequence of numbers between \fIlo\fP and \fIhi\fP
inclusive.  The number of points and spacing can be set with
other options (default: 100 points with linear spacing).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-r\fP \fIlo\fP,\fIhi\fP
The numbers will range from \fIlo\fP to \fIhi\fP, inclusive.
.sp
.TP
\fB-n\fP \fInum \fP
\fInum\fP (default: 100) numbers will be generated.
.sp
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIinc \fP
The spacing between points will be \fIinc\fP (default: use
the spacing function and \fInum\fP to determine).
.PP
At most one of \fB-n or \fB-d may be specified.
.TP
\fB-s\fP \fIfunc \fP
The numbers will be spaced using a \fIfunc\fP (default: linear)
function.  Acceptable values are "lin", "log", "exp", and
"sqrt".
.sp
.TP
\fB-f\fP \fIformat \fP
The numbers will be printed using the C format \fIformat\fP
(default: "%g").

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To generate 4 equally spaced points between 200 and 600:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	seq -r 200,600 -n 4
.ft R
.fi

.PP
To generate a list of wavelengths (in nm) between 200 and 400, for
processing by refdx to determine the refractive index of ice at 0C
in 2-nm increments:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	seq -r 200,400 | refdx -s ice -t 0 -u nm
.ft R
.fi

.PP
To generate 30 numbers between 0 and 10, with exponential spacing:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	seq -r 0,10 -n 30 -s exp
.ft R
.fi

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
\fB-d specified, \fB-n ignored
.br
	If \fB-n (number of points to generate) is specified as well as
	\fB-d (the spacing between points), the \fB-n option is ignored.
.sp
.TP
\fB-n too small, must be >= 3
.br
	At least 3 points must be requested.
.sp
.TP
[ \fB-f ..%..g.. or ..%..f.. or ..%..e.. ]
.br
	The format specification must be a valid C printf-style
	format.
.sp
.TP
range error: lo equals hi
.br
	The low and high values are equal.
.sp
.TP
no negative numbers with \fIfunc\fP spacing
.br
	The "log" and "sqrt" spacing functions do not allow negative
	numbers.
.sp
.TP
no non-positive numbers with \fIfunc\fP spacing
.br
	The "log" spacing function does not allow zero.
.sp
.TP
increment negative or zero
.br
	The spacing between points (the increment) must be positive
	if \fIlo\fP is less than \fIhi\fP.
.sp
.TP
increment positive or zero
.br
	The spacing between points (the increment) must be negative
	if \fIlo\fP is greater than \fIhi\fP.
.sp
.TP
math function error
.br
	A value given to the spacing function was invalid.
.sp
.TP
range error: increment out of range
range error: start out of range
range error: fin out of range
.br
	The function being ued has caused one of the variables
	to go out of range.  Lower the range values.
