\fBmklqh\fP - add a linear quantization (LQ) header to an image
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBmklqh\fP \fB-m\fP \fIin\fP,\fIout\fP[,\fIin\fP,\fIout\fP,\fI...\fP] [ \fB-u\fP \fIunits\fP ] [ \fB-i\fP \fIinterp\fP ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmklqh\fP constructs an IPW linear quantization header (LQH) and inserts
it into the headers of \fIimage\fP (default: standard input).  If the
specified bands already have LQ headers, they are overridden, and
a warning message is generated.
.PP
If the \fB-f option is specified, then only the headers are written to
the standard output, and any input image data is ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fIin\fP,\fIout\fP[,\fIin\fP,\fIout\fP,\fI...\fP]
Construct a linear mapping between the breakpoints
\fIin,out\fP,...  At least 1 \fIin,out\fP pair must be supplied.
The breakpoint pairs 0,0 and 2^nbits-1,0 are assumed
unless explicitly overridden.
.sp
.TP
\fB-u\fP \fIunits\fP
The floating-point pixel values are expressed in units of
\fIunits\fP (e.g., "W m^-2", "nm") (default: none).
This field is for annotation only.
.sp
.TP
\fB-i\fP \fIinterp\fP
Use \fIinterp\fP to interpolate floating-point values between
breakpoints (default: "linear").  Currently only "linear"
is supported.
.sp
.TP
\fB-b\fP \fIband\fP[,\fI...\fP]
The "lq" header will be applied only to the specified
\fIband\fPs (default: all bands).
.sp
.TP
\fB-f\fP
Force header output only.  Do not attempt to copy pixel
data from \fIimage\fP to the standard output.  Note that there
must still be at least an input BIH, and any input headers
(except superseded "lq" headers) will still be copied to
the standard output.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
\fIimage\fP
input image (default: standard input)
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To construct an "lq" header that will map 8-bit pixels (0 .. 255)
into the floating point range 0 .. 1:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
        mklqh -m 0,0,255,1
.ft R
.fi

.PP
To construct an "lq" header that will map 12-bit pixels (0 .. 4095)
into the range 2762 .. 3417:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
        mklqh -m 0,2762,4095,3417
.ft R
.fi
.SH FILES
.PP
None.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
bands \fIband1\fP and \fIband2\fP have different # bits / pixel
All bands to which the "lq" header is applied must have
the same number of bits per pixel.
.sp
.TP
must specify pixel,fpixel pairs for \fB-m
\fB-m must have an even number of arguments.
.sp
.TP
no band \fIband\fP
A nonexistent input band was specified with \fB-b.
.sp
.TP
band \fIband\fP: replacing previous LQ header
Band \fIband\fP already had a "lq" header, which was replaced
by the newly-created one.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
There are not yet any standard identifiers for \fIunits\fP.
.PP
The default breakpoints can lead to unexpected quantization mappings
or errors from \fBmklqh\fP.  For example, the mapping
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	mklqh -m 0,0,127,1
.ft R
.fi

.PP
succeeds for 7-bit pixels, but for 8-bit pixels there would be an
additional implicit breakpoint at 255,0, which would make the mapping
non-monotonic.
