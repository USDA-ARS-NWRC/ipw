.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmse\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBmse\fP calculates moist static energy MSE (J/kg) from air temp Ta,
vapor pressure ea, for specified elevation level z,
from input of Ta (C), ea (Pa), and z (m).
Or inverts moist static energy equation to
calculate vapor pressure for specified elevation level,
from input of Ta (C), MSE (J/kg), and z (m).
.PP
(see \fIDynamic Meteorology, Holton, 1979\fP)
