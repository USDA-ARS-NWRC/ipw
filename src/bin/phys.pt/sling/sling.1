.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBsling\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBsling\fP converts wet and dry bulb temps to vapor pressure;
Reads wet-dry pairs from standard input;
Calculates vapor pressure in Pascals (default) or mb;
Optional elevation, z, is used to calcualte air pressure;
Optional total air pressure (Pa); default is
sea level standard of 101324.6 Pa;
Optional output of dewpoint temp(K);
Output is to standard output;

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-z\fP \fIelev \fP
Use \fIelev\fP to calculate air pressure (default: sea level).
.sp
.TP
\fB-p\fP \fIpressure \fP
\fIpressure\fP is the total air pressure (default: sea level
standard of 101324.6 Pa).
.sp
.TP
\fB-m\fP
Vapor pressures are outputed in mb (default: Pa).
.sp
.TP
\fB-d\fP
Dew point temperatures are also outputed in degrees K.
