.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBsvp_slope\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBsvp_slope\fP computes the slope of the saturation vapor pressure
curve, used in the psychromentric equation, and in the Penman, Penman-Montieth,
and Priestly-Taylor methods of estimating evaporation and evapo-transpiration.
Uses both the gradient method (pg.215, eq 10.11, Brutsaert [1982]),
and the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (pg. 41, eq 3.22, Brutsaert [1982])
to compute the slope of the SVP curve as a function of temperature.
Output is in Pa/K.
