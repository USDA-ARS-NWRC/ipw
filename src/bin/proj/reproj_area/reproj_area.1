.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Reproj_area is part of an extensive suite of projection transformation
tools coded into IPW by Kelly Longley (OSU) at the EPA Laboratory
in Corvallis, Oregon.  All are based on the libraries from the
General Cartographic Transformation Package (GCTP), which were converted
to C from fortran during early 1990 by Ms. Longley.
.PP
Reproj_area calculates the coordinates in the output projection
space of the minimum area required to hold all unmasked points in
the given mask image.  All unmasked points are converted to the new
map projection using the USGS General Cartographic Transformation
Package (GCTP) software to determine the minimum bounding rectangle.
The input and output projection parameters are defined in files
inproj (\fB-i parameter) and outproj (\fB-o parameter) respectively
(see below for file format).  The coordinates in the output map
projection are written in ASCII to stdout in the order:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	min_easting max_easting min_northing max_northing
.ft R
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-i\fP \fIinproj\fP
input projection definition file
.sp
.TP
\fB-o\fP \fIoutproj\fP
output projection definition file
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
[\fImask\fP]
	mask	input mask image (default:stdin)
.sp
		If all bits are "on" (ie "mask" is not a mask file...) the
		bounding-box for the entire image is returned.
.sp
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To find the bounding-box for the Columbia River Basin when converting
from geodetic to Albers projections:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	reproj_area -i geo.defs -o albers.defs mask.geo.col
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Geo.defs and albers.defs are the projection definition files (see
mk.proj).
.SH FILES
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
     The projection definition files are ASCII files with the following
     format:
     	projection ID
     	units code
     	zone code
     	datum code
     	projection parameters (15 values)
     The files are created by using the program "mk.proj", but may be
     created with programs mkgeo, mkalbers, mkutm, mklamcc, etc.  See
     the USGS documentation for the General Cartographic Transformation
     Package for details on the parameters.
