.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBgradient\fP reads elevations from \fIimage\fP (default: standard input)
and writes a 2-band image of the slope and aspect (the magnitude
and direction of the \fBgradient\fP) to the standard output.
.PP
The 2-band output image has slope as its first band and
aspect as its second.  Slope is stored as sin(S) with range
from 0 to 1.  Aspect is stored as radians from south (aspect 0
is toward the south) with range from -pi to pi, with negative
values to the west and positive values to the east.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-s\fP
compute slope image only (default: compute both slope and
aspect images).
.sp
.TP
\fB-a\fP
compute aspect image only (default: compute both slope and
aspect images).
.sp
.TP
\fB-d\fP \fIdeltaL\fP[,\fIdeltaS\fP]
grid spacing (default: get grid spacing from the "geo"
header or set to 1 if no "geo" header).  If \fIdeltaS\fP is
also specified, use \fIdeltaL\fP for the input line spacing
and \fIdeltaS\fP for the input sample spacing.
.sp
.TP
\fB-i\fP \fISbits\fP[,\fIAbits\fP]
Use \fISbits\fP per output pixel (default: 8).  If \fIAbits\fP is
also specified, use \fISbits\fP bits per slope pixel and
\fIAbits\fP bits per aspect pixel.
.SH OPERANDS

[\fIimage\fP]

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To produce a nice-looking shaded-relief map from the DEM "elev.utah"
we can use the program shade, which needs slopes and aspects:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	gradient elev.utah | shade -z 45 -a -135

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
# bits must be >= 1
\fB-d \fIdelta\fP,\fIdelta\fP : must be positive
.br
	The arguments to the \fB-d and \fB-i options must be positive
	nonzero integers.
.sp
.TP
input file has \fInbands\fP bands
.br
	The input image must have only 1 band.
.sp
.TP
Elevation file has no GEOH, spacing set to 1.0
input file has no LQH; raw values used
input units "\fIunits\fP", should be "m"
.br
	These deficiencies in the input image will introduce
	linear errors into the slope calculations.
.sp
.TP
Elevation file should be standard orientation
.br
	The output azimuth values will have a systematic bias
	corresponding to the non-standard orientation of the
	input image.
.sp
.TP
spacing in geodetic header ignored
.br
	The \fB-d option overrides any pixel spacing information
	in the input image.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
\fBgradient\fP is optimized for terrain calculations (e.g., storing
slopes as sines offers increased precision for shallow slopes,
which are more common in nature), and may therefore be less
than ideal as a generic image derivative program.
.SH HISTORY
.TP
Jul 1990
	Written by James Frew, UCSB.
Base IPW routine (Frew, 1990)
.TP
Apr 1993
	Ran through Purify.  Dana Jacobsen, ERL-C.
.TP
May 1993
	Changed aspect calculation to explicitly handle cases
of dx or dy being zero.  Dana Jacobsen, ERL-C.
.SH BUGS
.PP
\fB-i should not be used for bits in output!  Use -n or -b, but that
would break all the scripts that depend on \fBgradient\fP as it is.
