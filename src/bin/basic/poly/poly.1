.SH NAME
.PP
\fBpoly\fP - print coordinates of pixels for in a polygon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBpoly\fP [ \fB-s\fP \fIx\fP,\fIy\fP ] [\fIfile\fP]
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpoly\fP reads polygon vertices from \fIfile\fP (default: standard input)
and prints the line and sample coordinates of all points on the
polygon lines.  If the \fB-s option is given, \fBpoly\fP also prints the
coordinates of each point inside the polygon.
.PP
The input is a list of integer (x,y) coordinates, one pair per line:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	x0 y0
	x1 y1
	...
.ft R
.fi

.PP
The output is a similar list, including all points that would lie
on a line between each successive input coordinate pair.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-s\fP \fIx\fP,\fIy\fP
Fill the input polygon.  The input coordinates must be
the vertices of a closed polygon (the last coordinate
pair must be the same as the first), and the specified
\fIx\fP,\fIy\fP must be inside the polygon.  The output will
contain all points inside the polygon, as well as all
points on the polygon's boundary.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
[\fIfile\fP]
	file	input file of polygon vertices
.sp
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following command:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	poly
	0 0
	0 3
.ft R
.fi

.PP
yields:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	0 0
	1 1
	2 2
	3 3
.ft R
.fi

.PP
If "roi" contains the corners (in intrinsic line and sample
coordinates) of a region-of-interest, then the following command
will inscribe the boundaries of the region onto "image":
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	poly roi | edimg -i image
.ft R
.fi

.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
The output coordinates appear in order of increasing (x,y)
regardless of the order of the input coordinates.
.PP
Output coordinates on polygon edges are generated by a Bresenham
algorithm.  If \fB-s is specified, then output coordinates inside a
polygon are generated by a flood-fill algorithm, using \fIx\fP,\fIy\fP as
a seed location.
