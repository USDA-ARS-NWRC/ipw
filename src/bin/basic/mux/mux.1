.SH NAME
.PP
\fBmux\fP - multiplex (combine) images into one multi-band image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
\fBmux\fP \fIimage1 image2 ...\fP
.ft R
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Mux band-interleaves the operand images into a single output image
that contains all of the input bands and writes the result to the
standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
None.
.SH OPERANDS
.TP
\fIimage1 image2 ...\fP
input images; the operand "-" means the standard input.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To combine "red", "green", and "blue" images into a single
"color" image:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	mux red green blue  >color
.ft R
.fi
.PP
To multiply "image1" by "image2":
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	mux image1 image2  |  mult
.ft R
.fi
.SH FILES
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
None.
.ft R
.fi
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
image size differs from 1st image
All input images must have the same number of lines and
samples.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
The input images must agree in every dimension except number of
bands.
.PP
The maximum number of input images is limited by the number of
files that a program may have open simultaneously.  This limit is
set in the C shell by the "limit" command.  Try a command like:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	limit descriptors 256
.ft R
.fi

.PP
to get more.  This limit can be worked around by piping one \fBmux\fP
into another:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	mux image1 ... imageN | mux - imageN+1 ...
.ft R
.fi
