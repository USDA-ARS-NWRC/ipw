.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBtrb_Ri\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBtrb_Ri\fP calculates turbulent transfer using Businger-Dyer model
with Richardson number (Ri) for stability determination;
(see:  \fIFleagle & Businger, An Introduction to Atmospheric
Physics, 1980, ch. 6\fP).  The Richardson number is used for the
stability parameter.  Air pressure is set from site elev.
.PP
If measurements are available from two heights, z and z0 are the upper and
lower heights, and the roughness length (effectively the height at which
the wind speed goes to 0.0) is estimated from the measured profile.
If measurements are available from only one height (as is usually the case),
z0 is the roughness length, t0 and e0 are the temperature and humidity at the
surface, and u0 is input as 0.0.
Roughness lengths vary from a few mm over smooth surfaces to several meters
over rough surfaces
(see: \fIBrutsaert, Evaporation into the Atmosphere, 1982, pg. 114\fP).
.PP
If temp/vapor pressure are measured at a different height
from wind speed, \fB-d\fP is set, again t0 and e0 are the temperature
and humidity at the surface, and z0 is the roughness length.
.PP
Reads input file from stdin:

	z, z0, t, t0, e, e0, u, u0

or, if "\fB-d" option is specified:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	zu, zt, z0, t, t0, e, e0, u
.ft R
.fi

.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	z  = upper height (m)
	z0 = lower height or roughness length (m)
	zu = wind speed height (m)
	zt = temp/humidity height (m)
	t  = upper temperature (C)
	t0 = lower or surface temperature (C)
	e  = upper vapor press. (Pa)
	e0 = lower or surface vapor press. (Pa)
	u  = upper wind speed (m/sec)
	u0 = lower wind speed (m/sec), or 0.0 if z0 = roughness length
.ft R

.PP
Outputs H and LE (W/m^2) and, if \fB-m\fP is set,
water gain/loss (+/-mm m^-2 s^-1).
Output is to stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-z\fP \fIelev \fP
site elevation (m) (default: 0.0m)
.sp
.TP
\fB-K\fP
Input temperatures are in degrees K (default: C).
.sp
.TP
\fB-m\fP
Output water gain/loss in mm/m^2 s^-1
.sp
.TP
\fB-d\fP
Indicates that zu (wind speed height) is not the same as
as zt (temp/humidity height).

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
For an open site in the mountains at 2500m, over snow:
.PP
With data from only one height, and a roughness length of 0.005m:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
            trb_Ri -z 2500 -m
            Input z,  z0,   t,  t0, e,  e0,   u,  u0;
                  3.0 0.005 3.0 0.0 300 610.7 2.5 0.0
yields
            H=19.52; LE=-41.60; EVAP=-1.559846e-05
.ft R
.fi

.PP
If these fluxes were sustained for an hour or a day,
the evaporation would be:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
            0.0562 mm/hr, 1.349 mm/day
.ft R
.fi

.PP
With data from two heights:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
            trb_Ri -z 2500 -m
            Input z,  z0, t,  t0, e,  e0, u,  u0;
                  3.0 1.0 3.0 2.8 300 310 2.5 0.5
yields:
            H=42.48; LE=-38.38; EVAP=-1.540340e-05
.ft R
.fi

.PP
If these fluxes were sustained for an hour or a day,
the evaporation would be:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
           0.0555 mm/hr, 1.332 mm/day
.ft R
.fi

.PP
With wind measured at a different height from temperature and humidity:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
           trb_Ri -z 2500 -m -d
           Input zu, zt, z0,   t,  t0, e,  e0,   u;
                 4.0 3.0 0.005 3.0 0.0 300 610.7 2.75
yields:
           H=19.54; LE=-41.52; EVAP=-1.557006e-05
.ft R

.PP
If these fluxes were sustained for an hour or a day,
