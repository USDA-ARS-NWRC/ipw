\fBgsnow\fP - heat flow between snow and soil

\fBgsnow\fP [ \fB-z\fP \fIelev \fP ] [ \fB-K\fP ]
.ft R

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBgsnow\fP is one of a group of commands designed to simulate energy,
climate, or hydrologic processes or properties at a point.
Most were originally written as "qdips" (Quick and Dirty Image
Processing System) programs by D. Marks, during the 1980's at UCSB.
.PP
\fBgsnow\fP calculates heat flow between snow layer and soil accounting
for both conduction and vapor transport;
(After Anderson, 1976, pg. 45-47; Davis, 1980)
Soil texture is assumed to be that of a sandy mineral soil
ranging from 0.3 J/(m sec K) for very dry (Peixoto & Oort, 1992)
to 2.2 J/(m sec K) for very wet or saturated (see Oke, 1978).
Air pressure set from elevation (sea level is default);
Temperatures in C (default) or K.
.PP
Reads infile from stdin:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	rho, tsno, tg, zs, zg
.ft R
.fi

.PP
where:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	rho   = snow density (kg/m**3)
	tsno  = snow temperature (C or K if "\fB-K\fP" is set)
	tg    = soil temperature (C or K if "\fB-K\fP" is set)
	zs    = height above surface of tsno measurement (m)
	zg    = depth of tg measurement (m)
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Outputs G, heat transfer between soil and snow (W/m**2) for three
thermal conductivities (wet sand, dry sand, and moist sand)
to stdout;
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-z\fP \fIelev \fP
\fIelev\fP is measurement site elevation (default: sea level)
.sp
.TP
\fB-K\fP
Input temperatures are in degrees K (default: C)
