\fBdespike\fP - remove abnormally large pixel values (spikes)
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBdespike\fP reads an single band \fIimage\fP (default: standard input) and
outputs a corresponding image to the standard output that has spikes
removed.
.PP
To determine whether a value is a spike, the pixel is first compared
to \fIlval\fP.  If it is below \fIlval\fP, it is not a spike.  If it is
above \fIlval\fP, but is larger than \fImult\fP times larger than it's 8
neighbors average, it is a spike and is replaced with the average.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-l\fP \fIlval\fP
Any value below \fIlval\fP (default: 0) will be passed through
unchanged.
.sp
.TP
\fB-p\fP \fImult\fP
Any value larger than \fImult\fP (default: 2) times the average
of it's	8 neighbors will be replaced with the average.  If
the pixel is on a corner, the edge line or column will be
replicated.
.sp
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fImask\fP
Use \fImask\fP as a mask image.  Any points in \fImask\fP that are
0 will have the corresponding points in \fIimage\fP passed
through unchanged.
.SH OPERANDS
.PP
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To replace every value of 255 and above with an average:

.SH BUGS
.PP
Images with more than one byte do not work.
.PP
Some more thought should go into the filter function.  This one
an deal with "salt" but not "pepper" distortion.
.PP
Even with a mask on, while not changing values within the mask,
the mask gets used as data values.
.PP
\fIlval\fP should be the image minimum value, rather than 0.
