.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBiinterp\fP reads a single-band image and creates an image whose
floating point pixel values are the results of linear interpolation
on the input image based on given X,Y pairs.
(Formerly called "ftransform")
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-n\fP \fInpts\fP
The file \fIpoint_file\fP contains \fInpts\fP X,Y pairs.
.sp
.TP
\fB-c\fP
Perform clipping.  Interpolation will be clipped at the
minimum and maximum X values given (default: linearly
extrapolate for points outside the given X values).
.sp
.TP
\fB-p\fP \fIpoint_file\fP
Read X,Y pairs from \fIpoint_file\fP (default: standard input).
.sp
.TP
\fB-i\fP \fIimage\fP
Read input image from \fIimage\fP (default: standard input).
.PP
At least one of \fB-p and/or \fB-i must be specified.
.TP
\fB-b\fP \fInbits\fP
Use \fInbits\fP per output pixel (default: same as input image).

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To create an image where wind speed varies as a simple function of
elevation, assuming that all elevations are between 1000 and 4000m,
and that wind speed varies linearly from 2 m/s at 1000m to 10 m/s
at 4000m:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	echo "1000 2.0 4000 10.0" | iinterp -b 8 -n 2 -i elev_img
.ft R

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
missing or illegal data in points file: \fIpts\fP points successfully read
.br
	An error of some kind occurred while reading the point file.
	Either a floating point number was mis-entered, or only one
	of the X,Y pair was specified.
.sp
.TP
points not sorted in ascending X-order
.br
	The X portions of the X,Y pairs must be sorted in ascending
	order.  They may not be equal to each other.
.sp
.TP
more than \fIpts\fP points in point file - remainder ignored
.br
	If more points are supplied than the \fB-n option specifies,
	the additional points will be ignored.
.sp
.TP
image has \fIbands\fP bands; single-band images only
.br
	Only single band images are supported.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
\fIimage\fP must have only one band.
