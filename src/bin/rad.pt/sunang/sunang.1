.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBsunang\fP calculates the sun angle (the azimuth and zenith angles
of the sun's position) for a given geodetic location at either a
single date and time (\fB-t option) or a list of dates and times
(\fB-t option absent).  The sun angles are written to standard
output.
.PP
If only a single date and time is specified with the \fB-t option,
the output is in the format:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	GMT {weekday} {month} {day} {hr}:{min}:{sec} {year}
	-z {degrees} -u {cos(z)} -a {degrees}  [-d {radius vector}]
.ft R
.fi

.PP
The first line contains the date and time.  The second line
contains the zenith angle, the cosine of the zenith angle, and
the solar azimuth.  If the \fB-d option is specified, then the Earth-
Sun radius vector is added to the second line.  This second line
is suitable for direct substitution into the command lines of
several other IPW programs (horizon, shade, etc.).
.PP
If the \fB-t option is not present, then a list of dates and times
is read from standard input where each date and time is in this
format:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	{year},{month},{day},{hr},{min},{sec}
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Note:  If date/time is read from standard input, then {min}, {sec} are
not optional, and each line must include {year},{month},{day},{hr},{min},{sec}
even if {min}, {sec} are 0.
.PP
For each date and time, a single line is written that contains
the zenith angle, the cosine of the zenith angle, the solar
azimuth, and the optional radius vector (\fB-d option):
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	{zenith} {cosine(zenith)} {azimuth} [ {radius vector} ]
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Times are in GMT by default, unless a zone is specified.  Latitudes
in southern hemisphere and longitudes in western hemisphere are
negative.  The azimuth reference is 0 toward the south, with
negative azimuths west of south.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-t\fP \fIyr\fP,\fImon\fP,\fIday\fP,\fIhr\fP[,\fImin\fP[,\fIsec\fP]]
Calculate sun angle on date \fIyr\fP/\fImon\fP/\fIday\fP at time
\fIhr\fP:\fImin\fP:\fIsec\fP GMT.  \fIyr\fP must be fully specified
(i.e., 90 means 90 A.D., not 1990).  \fIhr\fP is 24-hour time.
(Default: read dates and times from standard input.)
.sp
.TP
\fB-b\fP \fIdeg\fP[,\fImin\fP,[,\fIsec\fP]]
Calculate sun angle at latitude \fIdeg\fP,\fImin\fP,\fIsec\fP.
South latitudes are negative.
.sp
.TP
\fB-l\fP \fIdeg\fP[,\fImin\fP[,\fIsec\fP]]
Calculate sun angle at longitude \fIdeg\fP,\fImin\fP,\fIsec\fP.
West longitudes are negative.
.PP
When read from command line, \fImin\fP and \fIsec\fP for the \fB-t, \fB-b,
and \fB-l options default to 0 if not specified. If Date/Time is read from
standard input, \fImin\fP and \fIsec\fP must be included, even if they are 0.
.TP
\fB-s\fP \fIslope\fP
Calculate sun angle for a surface with a slope of
\fIdeg\fP (0 .. 90) degrees (default: 0).
.sp
.TP
\fB-a\fP \fIazm\fP
Calculate sun angle for a surface with an azimuth of
\fIdeg\fP (-180 .. 180) degrees (default: 0).
.sp
.TP
\fB-r\fP
All angles are specified in radians (default: degrees,
minutes, seconds for \fB-b and \fB-l; decimal degrees for
\fB-s and \fB-a).
.sp
.TP
\fB-z\fP \fIzone\fP
The time values are in the time zone which is \fImin\fP minutes
west of Greenwich (default: 0).  For example, if input times
are in Pacific Standard Time, then \fImin\fP would be 480.
.sp
.TP
\fB-y\fP
The time values are in daylight savings time (default:
standard time).
.sp
.TP
\fB-d\fP
Print Earth-Sun radius vector in addition to the sun angle.
.sp
.TP
\fB-f\fP
Force the printing of date, time, and zenith angle, even
when the output is not to a terminal.  Only applies to the
\fB-t option.
.SH OPERANDS
.PP
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To calculate the sun angle in Santa Barbara on 15 February 1990
at 12:30 PM Pacific Standard Time:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	sunang -b 34,25 -l -119,54 -t 1990,2,15,12,30 -z 480
.ft R
.fi

.PP
The output would be:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	GMT Thu Feb 15 20:30:00 1990
	-z 47.122 -u 0.680436 -a -5.413
.ft R
.fi

.PP
Given a DEM image for the Santa Barbara area, the following could
be used to generate an index of local beam irradiance (discounting
atmospheric effects):
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	gradient {dem} | shade `sunang {options as above} | tail -1`
.ft R
.fi
.SH FILES
.PP
None.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
None.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
\fB-r does not change the output representations of zenith and
azimuth -- they are always printed as decimal degrees.

Aug 1992
Moved support files (ephemeris, gmt, julday, rotate,
sunpath, tmconv, unixtime, weekday, xdysize, yrday) into
libipw/\fBsunang\fP since they are used by other programs also.
