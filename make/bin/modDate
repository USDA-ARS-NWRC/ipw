#  NAME
#	modDate - print modification date-time for a file
#
#  SYNOPSIS
#	modDate [-t] file ...
#
#
#  DESCRIPTION
#	modDate prints the modification date-time of each file
#	specified.  If only 1 file is specified, its modification
#	date-time is written to standard output on a single line.  If
#	more than 1 file is specified, then the script writes an output
#	line for each file in this format:
#
#		filename: date-time
#
#	If a file does not exist, its modification date-time is printed
#	as "?".
#
#  OPTIONS
#	-t	This causes the full date-time to be printed in this
#		format:
#
#			month day, year time
#
#		where the month is a 3-letter abbreviation.  The default
#		format just prints the date portion as:
#
#			day month year
#
#		where month is the full name of the month, e.g. January.
#
#  OPERANDS
#	file	A file whose modification date will be printed.
#
#  EXAMPLES
#	If the current directory contained the following files:
#
#	     % ls -l
#	     -rw-r--r--   1 ipw      usgs          171 Aug  7  1992 Makefile
#	     -rw-r--r--   1 ipw      usgs         4983 May 23  1996 main.c
#	     -rwxrwxr-x   1 ipw      usgs        56232 Mar 31 14:53 a.out
#
#
#	then, here's how to print the modification dates for all the
#	files:
#
#	     % modDate *
#	     Makefile: 7 August 1992
#	     main.c: 23 May 1996
#	     a.out: 31 March 1997
#
#	To display the dates and times for all the files:
#
#	     % modDate -t *
#	     Makefile: Aug 7, 1992 03:45
#	     main.c: May 23, 1996 22:01
#	     a.out: Mar 31, 1998 14:53
#
#	To display just a single file's modification date:
#
#	     % modDate main.c
#	     23 May 1996
#
#  FILES
#	None.
#
#  DIAGNOSTICS
#	None.
