.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBmsurface\fP works in conjunction with the "msurfprep" program to
provide a much faster means of interpolating multiple surfaces from
the same set of input data points.
.PP
\fBmsurface\fP reads in an ASCII file of data points and a multi-band
IPW image of nearest-neighbor information (created by "msurfprep")
and constructs an IPW image by spatial interpolation using an
inverse-distance squared weighting algorithm.
.PP
The only difference between \fBmsurface\fP and
the IPW "surface" program is that \fBmsurface\fP
reads nearest-neighbor
information from an image, rather than performing an exhaustive
search for each pixel value to be interpolated.  The nearest-
neighbor image is produced by the program "msurfprep".
\fBmsurface\fP
also handles cases of missing data, while surface does not.
Note that while surface reads {# of output bits} and lq header
information (if any) from its input header, \fBmsurface\fP gets these
values from the command line.
.PP
\fBmsurface\fP is best suited for tasks which require many interpolations
over the same set of points, but using different data each time
(e.g. for producing 365 daily temperature surfaces from a single
set of meterological stations where each station has 365
temperature observations).

     WARNING:  The pixel values of the input nearest-neighbor
               image are simply the positions of each
               point within {points file}.  When the msurface
               program is run, it must be given a {points file}
               that corresponds EXACTLY with the easting/northing values
               that were used by msurfprep.  This means that the points
               files used by msurfprep and msurface must not be sorted
               differently.  If the points files are not compatible,
               msurface may run with no errors and output
               gargage.  To verify that the points files are
               compatible, use awk to extract the first two fields of
               each points file, and then compare these fields with
               the Unix "diff" command.  (See EXAMPLES below.)

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.TP
\fB-p\fP \fIpoints\fP
Points will be read in from {points file}.
The input file contains three values per line, formatted:
.sp
easting  northing  value
.sp
where the easting and northing are specified in the same
coordinate system as given in the "geo" header.
.sp
NOTE:  The easting/northing values in this file must
correspond exactly with the point file used by the msurfprep
command to create \fIimage\fP.  (See EXAMPLES below.)
.sp
.TP
\fB-n\fP
The number of nearest neighbors used for interpolation will
be \fInpoints\fP (default: 4).  This number may not be larger
than the number of bands in the input image.  If many
nodata values exist, \fInpoints\fP should be smaller than the
number of input bands in \fIimage\fP.  Otherwise, if \fBmsurface\fP
fails to find \fInpoints\fP valid data values from \fIimage\fP,
it must perform an exhaustive search (slow).
.sp
.TP
\fB-f\fP
Points with the value {nodata flag} (default: -9999) will
be ignored by the interpolation routine.
.sp
.TP
\fB-b\fP
Use \fIbits\fP bits per output pixel (default: 8).
.sp
.TP
\fB-q\fP
Use \fIval,val\fP as the min,max values in the output lq header.
The default is to use the min,max of the point values
in {points file}.
.sp
.TP
\fB-g\fP
Use spherical great-circle-distance computation.
If \fB-g\fP is not set, use default Euclidean distance computation.
.sp
.TP
\fB-m\fP
The file \fImask\fP (default: none) will be used to define what
parts of the output surface are filled in.  Points in \fImask\fP
that are 0 will be left 0 in the output image.
.SH OPERANDS
image
An image made by msurfprep which contains nearest-neighbor
information.  Band 0 of {image} stores, for each pixel,
the position in {points file} of the nearest point.  Band 1
stores the next-nearest point, etc.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To create an input nearest-neighbor image:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	msurfprep -h hdr.file -p pt.file1 > neibs.img
.ft R
.fi

.PP
To interpolate a surface with \fBmsurface\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	msurface -p pt.file2 neibs.img > outsurf.img
.ft R
.fi

.PP
To check that pt.file1 and pt.file2 refer to the same set of
eastings/northings:
.sp
.nf
.ft CR
	awk '{print $1,$2}' pt.file1 > foo1
	awk '{print $1,$2}' pt.file2 > foo2
	diff foo1 foo2

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
.TP
error reading point \fInpoint\fP from input file
.sp
.TP
requested # points exceeds # bands in input image
.br
	\fInpoints\fP may not be greater than the number of
	stored neighbors (bands) in the input image.
.sp
.TP
input image and point file do not reference the same set of points.
.br
	\fBmsurface\fP compares the coordinate values in {point file} to
	those stored in the header of the input image.  If the
	values don't match exactly, the program terminates.
.sp
.TP
input image has no geodetic header
.br
	The input image must have a GEO header.
.sp
.TP
WARNING: Using Euclidean distance with 'deg' units.
.br
     If units are degrees, one usually wants to use the \fB-g\fP option
	     for spherical distance computation.
.sp
.TP
WARNING: Using geo distance with seemingly non-geo units.
.br
             \fB-g\fP was invoked, but coordinates are beyond the range
             of valild latitudes/longitites.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
If the input point file has large amounts of missing data
observations, then \fBmsurface\fP will run slowly.  If \fBmsurface\fP fails
to get \fInpoints\fP valid data points from the input image for a
given cell to be interpolated, then it is
forced to perform an exhaustive search on all of the input points.
Therefore, when nodata values are present, the number of bands in
the input image should be as large as possible.
.PP
The mask image must be single band.
.PP
Map projection distortions can introduce significant
error in distance computations as the spatial extent of
the image increases, or if an improper map projection is used.
For example, interpolating a surface over an Arctic region while
using a US Albers projection would produce unusual (and incorrect)
results.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.PP
The \fB-g\fP option is slow!  Need to implement trig lookup tables.
